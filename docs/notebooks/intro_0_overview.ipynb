    "## What is `mlcolvar`\n",
    "`mlcolvar`, which stands for Machine Learning COLlective VARiables, is Python library designed to aid the design of data-driven reaction coordinates for atomistic simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The guiding principles of `mlcolvar` are twofold. On one hand, we wanted to develop a unified framework to help test and deploy CVs proposed in the literature. On the other hand, we tried to do so in a modular way which could simplify also the development of new approaches and the cross contamination between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The library is based on Pytorch machine learning library, and we decided to rely on the Lightning high-level package to simplify the overall workflow and focus on the design of the CVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While of course it can be used as a standalone tool (e.g. for analysis of MD simulations), its primary purpose is thought to be in the workflow of enhanced sampling in combination with PLUMED. Thus, the input features are thought to come from PLUMED and the final result will be a serialized model which can be deployed in PLUMED via the LibTorch C++ interface.\n",
    "Note that, at variance with other ML workflow, this implies that all the pre and processing steps (e.g. standardization of the input data) has to be saved inside the model to avoid repeating them in PLUMED which could be a tedious and/or complex task."

    "Each CV then has a `loss_fn` attribute that sets the loss function which has to be minimized for the optimization of the trainable blocks. On the other hand, the optimizer for the training over the trainable weights of the model is set as a property of the model.\n",

    "In addition to the core of the CV class the user can also prepend and append pre and postprocessing models. These are in general thought to be `Transform` object, as they are not trainable, but in principle they could generic `torch.nn.Module`.\n",
    "This possiblity allows to perform the non-trainable preprocessing operations on the dataset only once at the beginning of the training and to include anyways such operations in the final model for exporting, testing etc.\n",
