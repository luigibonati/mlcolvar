    Parameters
    ----------
    positions: numpy.ndarray (shape: [N, 3])
        The positions array.
    cutoff: float
        The cutoff radius.
    pbc: Tuple[bool, bool, bool] (shape: [3])
        If to enable PBC in the directions of the three lattice vectors.
    cell: numpy.ndarray (shape: [3, 3])
        The lattice vectors.
    true_self_interaction: bool
        If to keep self-edges that don't cross periodic boundaries.
    system_indices: List[int]
        Indices of the atoms to be considered as the 'system' if 
        restricting the neighborhood to a subsystem (i.e., system + environment), see also Notes section.
    environment_indices: List[int]
        Indices of the atoms to be considered as the 'environment' if 
        restricting the neighborhood to a subsystem (i.e., system + environment), see also Notes section.
        Only atoms within the cutoff will be included as active enviroment atoms
    buffer: float
        Buffer size used in finding active environment atoms, if 
        restricting the neighborhood to a subsystem (i.e., system + environment), see also Notes section.
    
    Returns
    -------
    edge_index: numpy.ndarray (shape: [2, n_edges])
        The edge indices (i.e., source and destination) in the graph.
    shifts: numpy.ndarray (shape: [n_edges, 3])
        The shift vectors (unit_shifts * cell_lengths).
    unit_shifts: numpy.ndarray (shape: [n_edges, 3])
        The unit shift vectors (number of PBC crossed by the edges).
   
    Notes
    -----
    Arguments `system_indices` and `environment_indices` must present at the
    same time. When these arguments are given, only edges in the [subsystem]
    formed by [the systems atoms] and [the environment atoms within the cutoff
    radius of the systems atoms] will be kept.
    These two lists could not contain common atoms.
