`mlcolvar` is a Python library aimed to help design data-driven collective-variables (CVs) for enhanced sampling simulations. The key features are:

1. A unified framework to help test and use (some) of the CVs proposed in the literature. 
2. A modular interface to simplify the development of new approaches and the contamination between them.
3. A streamlined distribution of CVs in the context of advanced sampling. 

The library is built upon the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) ML library as well as the [Lightning](https://lightning.ai/) high-level framework. 

---

Some of the **CVs** which are implemented, organized by learning setting:
- _Unsupervised_: PCA, (Variational) AutoEncoders [[1](http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1002/jcc.25520),[2](http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1021/acs.jctc.1c00415)]
- _Supervised_: LDA [[3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00733)], DeepLDA [[4](http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1021/acs.jpclett.0c00535)], DeepTDA [[5](http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1021/acs.jpclett.1c02317)]
- _Time-informed_: TICA [[6](http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1063/1.4811489)], DeepTICA/SRVs [[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113533118),[8](http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1063/1.5092521)], VDE [[9](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.97.062412)]

And many others can be implemented based on the building blocks or with simple modifications. Check out the [tutorials](https://mlcolvar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials.html) and the [examples](https://mlcolvar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html) section of the documentation.

**Install with `pip`**

The library is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mlcolvar/) and can be installed with `pip`. This is the preferred choice for **users** as it automatically installs the package requirements. 

```bash
pip install mlcolvar
```

**Clone from GitHub**

The library can also be installed cloning the repository from GitHub. This is the preferred choice for **developers** as it provides more flexibility and allows editable installation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luigibonati/mlcolvar.git
cd mlcolvar
pip -e install .
```



---

**PLUMED interface**: the resulting CVs can be deployed for enhancing sampling with the [PLUMED](https://www.plumed.org/) package via the [pytorch](https://www.plumed.org/doc-master/user-doc/html/PYTORCH_MODEL/) interface, available since version 2.9. 

---

**Notes**: in early versions (`v<=0.2.*`) the library was called `mlcvs`. This is still accessible for compatibility with PLUMED masterclasses in the [releases](https://github.com/luigibonati/mlcolvar/releases) or by cloning the `pre-lightning` branch.
